# Breast-Cancer-Detection

Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), sometimes called infiltrating ductal carcinoma, is the most common type of breast cancer. About 80% of all breast cancers are invasive 
ductal carcinomas.

“Invasive ductal carcinoma” refers to cancer that has broken through the wall of the milk duct and begun to invade the tissues of the breast. Over time, invasive ductal 
carcinoma can spread to the lymph nodes and possibly to other areas of the body.

# `Dataset`

Dataset contains 277524 patches, out of which 1,98,738 are IDC (-) and 78,786 are IDC (+). 
I am extracting 50 x 50 pixels from each image to perform operation.
